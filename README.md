To start working with this repo first clone it with the command 
git clone <repo name>

Alternatively you may use the clone button in visual studio. Once the repo is cloned onto your system, you may then make any changes you wish.
After completing your changes, make sure to Stage and Commit them
Then Push them back into this repo on the master branch. You should set up your git correctly with your name and email address. In addition when making commits, make sure to write a very descriptive label, so that I can easily see which changes each person made. There is nothing wrong with modifying or changing what someone has already done like field names and values and stuff like that. Just make sure to commit and push, so that I'll have a record of it.

Have fun.
